# CV Application

This is my first React project. It's a simple CV generation app where users can input their personal and professional details to generate a basic CV preview.

## Deployment

The app is deployed on Netlify and can be accessed here: [Live Demo](https://cv-generator-s.netlify.app/)  

## Features

- Home page to start a new CV.

- Form to enter info like name, email, experience, skills, etc.

- Result page showing the generated CV.

- Basic styling with CSS for a clean, modern look.

## Project Structure

Based on the provided screenshot:

- **src/**

  - **components/**: Contains `showPage.tsx` (with HomePage, EnterInfo, Result components).

  - **styles/**: CSS files like `EnterInfo.css`, `global.css`, `HomePage.css`, `Result.css`.

  - `App.tsx`: Main app logic with state management.

  - `main.tsx`: Entry point.

- Other files: `index.html`, `package.json`, `.gitignore`, `eslint.config.js`, `LICENSE`, etc.


Built with React, TypeScript, and CSS. Feel free to contribute or improve!
